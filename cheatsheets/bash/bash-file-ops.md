## üîÑ Workflows

### 1. Creating a new directory and moving a file

1. `mkdir my_new_folder`
2. `mv old_file.txt my_new_folder/`
3. `cd my_new_folder`
4. `ls` (to verify `old_file.txt` is there)

### 2. Searching for files

1. `find . -name "*.log"` (Find all log files in current dir and subdirs)
2. `grep -r "error" /var/log` (Search for "error" in all files under /var/log)

## üí° Examples

```bash
# List all files and hidden files, including details
ls -la

# Create a new directory and navigate into it
mkdir projects/my_app && cd projects/my_app

# Copy a file to another location
cp report.txt /tmp/backup_report.txt

# Move a file (rename it)
mv old_name.log new_name.log

# Delete a directory recursively
rm -rf unused_assets/

# View content of a file
cat /etc/hosts
```
