## ðŸŒ¿ **Core Principles of Coriander Growing**

### **Fundamental Concepts**

| Principle                       | Description                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Climate Requirements**  | Prefers cool temperatures (10â€“29Â°C) with partial shade      |
| **Soil & Drainage**       | Well-draining, rich, loose soil with a pH of 6.2â€“6.8         |
| **Watering & Irrigation** | Keep soil moist but avoid waterlogging                        |
| **Fertilization**         | Organic compost or balanced NPK fertilizer for optimal growth |
| **Pruning & Maintenance** | Encourages strong leaves and prevents bolting                 |

### **Essential Growing Stages**

| Stage                             | Process                                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Seed Preparation**        | Soak seeds in water for 24 hours before planting                         |
| **Transplanting**           | Plant seeds directly in soil, spacing them Â½ inch deep                  |
| **Growth Phase**            | Water regularly, thin seedlings, and fertilize periodically              |
| **Flowering & Pollination** | Regular harvesting delays bolting                                        |
| **Harvesting**              | Leaves can be picked when plants reach 6 inches; seeds after flowers dry |

### **Optimizing Coriander Growth**

1. **Choose the right variety** based on climate (Slow Bolt, Santo, Cruiser).
2. **Ensure proper drainage** to prevent root rot.
3. **Protect from pests** like aphids and slugs.

### **Enhancing Leaf Production**

1. **Harvest frequently** to encourage new growth.
2. **Prune selectively** to allow light penetration.
3. **Monitor soil nutrients** to sustain healthy growth.
