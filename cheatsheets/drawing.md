## ðŸŽ¨ **Drawing Techniques**

### **Basic Drawing Methods**

| Technique                 | Description                            |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Sketching**       | Quick, loose strokes to outline shapes |
| **Contour Drawing** | Defines edges and outlines of objects  |
| **Gesture Drawing** | Captures movement and fluidity         |
| **Cross-Hatching**  | Uses intersecting lines for shading    |
| **Blending**        | Smooth transitions between tones       |

### **Advanced Drawing Techniques**

| Technique                        | Description                            |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Perspective Drawing**    | Creates depth using vanishing points   |
| **Foreshortening**         | Depicts objects in compressed space    |
| **Chiaroscuro**            | Strong contrast between light and dark |
| **Stippling**              | Uses dots for texture and shading      |
| **Negative Space Drawing** | Focuses on the space around objects    |

## ðŸ”„ **Workflows**

### **Optimizing Drawing Skills**

1. Start with **basic shapes** before refining details.
2. Use **light sketching** to build structure.
3. Experiment with **different shading techniques**.

### **Enhancing Composition & Creativity**

1. Apply **rule of thirds** for balanced framing.
2. Use **perspective techniques** for depth.
3. Incorporate **contrast and texture** for realism.

## ðŸ’¡ **Examples**

```plaintext
# Example: Cross-Hatching Shading
1. Draw parallel lines for base shading.  
2. Add intersecting lines for darker areas.  
3. Adjust density for smooth transitions.
