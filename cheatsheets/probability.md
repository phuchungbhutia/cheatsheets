## ðŸŽ² **Core Principles for Probability**

### **Fundamental Concepts**

| Principle                         | Description                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Probability Definition**  | Probability of an event occurring:\( P(A) = \frac{\text{Favorable Outcomes}}{\text{Total Outcomes}} \) |
| **Range of Probability**    | Probability values range from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain)                                            |
| **Complement Rule**         | \( P(A') = 1 - P(A) \) (Probability of an event NOT occurring)                                         |
| **Conditional Probability** | \( P(A                                                                                                 |
| **Bayes' Theorem**          | \( P(A                                                                                                 |

### **Essential Probability Rules**

| Rule                               | Formula                                                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Addition Rule**            | \( P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) \)              |
| **Multiplication Rule**      | \( P(A \cap B) = P(A) P(B) \) (if A and B are independent) |
| **Law of Total Probability** | \( P(A) = P(A                                              |
| **Expected Value**           | \( E(X) = \sum x P(x) \)                                   |
| **Variance Formula**         | \( \sigma^2 = E(X^2) - (E(X))^2 \)                         |

## ðŸ”„ **Workflows**

### **Optimizing Probability Problem Solving**

1. **Define the sample space** and list possible outcomes.
2. **Apply probability rules** based on event relationships.
3. **Use conditional probability** for dependent events.

### **Enhancing Probability Understanding**

1. **Practice solving probability problems** step by step.
2. **Use tree diagrams and Venn diagrams** for visualization.
3. **Check answers** using logical reasoning and calculations.

## ðŸ’¡ **Examples**

```plaintext
# Example: Calculating Probability of Rolling a 6 on a Die
Total outcomes = 6  
Favorable outcome = 1 (rolling a 6)  
Probability = \( \frac{1}{6} \)  
```
