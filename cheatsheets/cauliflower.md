## ðŸ”„ **Workflows**

### **Optimizing Cauliflower Growth**

1. **Choose the right variety** based on climate (Snowball, Purple, Romanesco).
2. **Ensure proper spacing** (60 cm apart) to allow full head development.
3. **Protect from frost** using covers or mulch in colder climates.

### **Enhancing Yield & Quality**

1. **Rotate crops** to prevent soil depletion and disease buildup.
2. **Prune damaged leaves** to maintain plant health.
3. **Monitor soil nutrients** to sustain healthy growth.
