## üîÑ **Workflows**

### **Optimizing Wine Fermentation**

1. **Use high-quality yeast strains** for better alcohol conversion.
2. **Monitor temperature** to prevent spoilage.
3. **Ensure proper aeration** for yeast activity.

### **Enhancing Wine Flavor & Aging**

1. **Store in oak barrels** for richer taste.
2. **Allow proper aging time** for complexity.
3. **Use glass bottles** for long-term preservation.
