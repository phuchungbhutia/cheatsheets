## üîÑ Workflows

### **Basic Navigation & File Management**

1. Navigate to the target directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/directory
   ```
2. List all files in long format:
   ```bash
   ls -lh
   ```
3. Create a new directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir new_folder
   ```
4. Move a file to another directory:
   ```bash
   mv old_file.txt new_folder/
   ```
5. Remove a file permanently:
   ```bash
   rm old_file.txt
   ```

### **Script Creation & Execution**

1. Create a new Bash script file:
   ```bash
   nano script.sh
   ```
2. Add shebang at the top of the file:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   ```
3. Write commands inside the script. Example content:
   ```bash
   echo "Hello, this is my script!"
   ```
4. Save and exit (`Ctrl + X`, then `Y` and `Enter`).
5. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x script.sh
   ```
6. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./script.sh
   ```

### **Process & System Monitoring**

1. Display currently running processes:
   ```bash
   ps aux
   ```
2. Find a specific process by name:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep process_name
   ```
3. Kill a process by its ID:
   ```bash
   kill PID
   ```
4. Monitor real-time system performance:
   ```bash
   top
   ```
