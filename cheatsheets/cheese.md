## ðŸ§€ **Core Principles of Cheese Making**

### **Fundamental Concepts**

| Principle                  | Description                                              |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Milk Selection**   | Determines texture and flavor of the cheese              |
| **Acidification**    | Converts lactose into lactic acid for curd formation     |
| **Coagulation**      | Uses rennet or acids to solidify milk proteins           |
| **Curd Processing**  | Cutting, cooking, and draining curds for texture control |
| **Aging & Ripening** | Develops flavor and consistency over time                |

### **Cheese Making Process**

| Step                             | Description                                |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Milk Preparation**       | Selecting and pasteurizing milk            |
| **Acidification**          | Adding starter cultures to develop acidity |
| **Coagulation**            | Using rennet or acids to form curds        |
| **Curd Cutting & Cooking** | Adjusting moisture and texture             |
| **Draining & Pressing**    | Removing excess whey and shaping cheese    |
| **Salting & Aging**        | Enhancing flavor and preserving cheese     |

## ðŸ”„ **Workflows**

### **Optimizing Cheese Fermentation**

1. **Use high-quality milk** for better texture.
2. **Monitor temperature** to prevent spoilage.
3. **Ensure proper aeration** for bacterial activity.

### **Enhancing Cheese Flavor & Aging**

1. **Store in controlled humidity** for proper ripening.
2. **Allow aging time** for complexity.
3. **Use different cultures** for unique flavors.

## ðŸ’¡ **Examples**

```plaintext
# Example: Basic Cheese Recipe
1. 4 liters milk (cow, goat, or sheep)  
2. 1 packet starter culture  
3. 1 tsp rennet  
4. 1 tbsp salt  
5. Heat milk to 32Â°C (90Â°F), add culture and rennet, let curds form, drain, press, and age.
