## ðŸ”„ **Workflows**

### **Choosing Between Mutual Funds & SIP**

1. **Opt for SIP** if you prefer disciplined, gradual investing.
2. **Choose lump sum mutual funds** if you have surplus funds for immediate investment.
3. **Consider risk tolerance**â€”SIP reduces volatility impact, lump sum may be riskier.

### **Enhancing Investment Strategy**

1. **Diversify across funds** to balance risk and returns.
2. **Monitor fund performance** periodically for adjustments.
3. **Align investments with financial goals** (short-term vs long-term).
