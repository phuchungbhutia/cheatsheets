## üéØ Project Objective

Our goal is to build a **professionally structured GitHub repository** that provides a comprehensive and ever-expanding collection of **developer cheatsheets** in Markdown format. This hub aims to be user-friendly, auto-indexing, and easily accessible through a dedicated **GitHub Pages website**. Key features include:

* **Live Search**: Quickly find the commands and workflows you need.
* **Categorized Browse**: Explore cheatsheets by topic (e.g., `bash`, `git`, `python`, `javascript`).
* **Community-Driven Contributions**: A streamlined process for developers to add or improve cheatsheets.
* **Auto-Indexing**: Cheatsheet listings are automatically updated via GitHub Actions.
* **Responsive Navigation**: A smooth experience across all devices.

## üåê GitHub Pages UI

Our GitHub Pages site provides a seamless experience:

* **Fixed Navigation Bar**: Stays visible for easy access.
* **Responsive Dropdown Menu**: Adapts for mobile and desktop Browse.
* **Floating Search Bar**: Dynamically filters cheatsheets by name.
* **In-Page Markdown Rendering**: View cheatsheets directly within the website, no raw `.md` files exposed.

---

## üîÅ Automation & GitHub Actions

We leverage GitHub Actions for efficient maintenance:

* **`scripts/generate-cheatsheets-json.js`**: A Node.js script that recursively reads Markdown files, groups them by category, converts them to HTML, and updates `docs/index.html`, `docs/cheatsheet-viewer.html`, `docs/cheatsheets.json`, and `docs/cheatsheet-content/`.
* **`.github/workflows/auto-index.yml`**: A GitHub Actions workflow that triggers on any change to a Markdown file in `cheatsheets/`, runs the index generator script, and commits the updated files back to the repository.

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! To add or update a cheatsheet:

1.  **Fork** this repository.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Commit Best Practices & How-Tos

Clear, concise, and descriptive commit messages are crucial for project maintainability, collaboration, and understanding the history of changes. Follow these guidelines for your contributions:

### 1. **Structure Your Commit Messages**

A good commit message consists of a subject line and an optional, but recommended, body.

* **Subject Line (50-72 characters)**:
    
    * Summarizes the change in a single line.
    * Use the **imperative mood** (e.g., "Add new feature," "Fix bug," "Update documentation" instead of "Added new feature," "Fixes bug," "Updating documentation").
    * Capitalize the first letter.
    * Do **not** end with a period.
* **Body (Optional, but detailed)**:
    
    * Provide more context and explanation for the change.
    * Explain *why* the change was made, *what* problem it solves, and *how* it was implemented.
    * Wrap lines at 72 characters.
    * Separate the subject from the body with a blank line.
    
    **Example:**
    
    ```
    feat: Add new Python list comprehension cheatsheet
    
    This commit introduces a new cheatsheet for Python list comprehensions.
    It covers basic syntax, conditional expressions, nested comprehensions,
    and common use cases. This addresses the request for more Python-specific
    content and aims to provide quick references for common Python patterns.
    ```

### 2. **Make Atomic Commits**

* Each commit should represent a single, logical, and self-contained change.
* Avoid committing multiple unrelated changes in one go. If you're fixing a bug and adding a new feature, commit them separately.
* This makes it easier to review, revert, or cherry-pick specific changes.

### 3. **Reference Issues (If Applicable)**

* If your commit relates to a specific GitHub Issue, reference it in the commit message body using keywords like `Fixes #ISSUE_NUMBER`, `Closes #ISSUE_NUMBER`, or `Refs #ISSUE_NUMBER`. This automatically links the commit to the issue and can even close the issue when the commit is merged into the default branch.
    
    **Example:**
    
    ```
    fix: Correct typo in Git basics cheatsheet
    
    Found and fixed a minor typo in the 'git-basics.md' file under the
    "Commands" section. The previous text had a grammatical error.
    
    Fixes #123
    ```

### 4. **How to Write a Good Commit Message**

When making a commit, consider these questions:

* **What** was changed? (Subject line)
* **Why** was this change made? (Body)
* **How** was it implemented? (Body - if not obvious)
* **What problem** does it solve? (Body)
* **What impact** does it have? (Body)

### 5. **Using Git Commands for Commits**

* **Staging changes:**
    
    ```bash
    git add .                     # stages all changes
    git add cheatsheets/git/git-basics.md # stages specific file
    ```
* **Committing with a subject line:**
    
    ```bash
    git commit -m "feat: Add new cheatsheet template"
    ```
* **Committing with a subject and body:**
    
    ```bash
    git commit -m "feat: Introduce comprehensive Bash scripting cheatsheet" -m "This cheatsheet provides detailed examples and workflows for common Bash scripting tasks, including variable handling, loops, conditionals, and functions. It aims to be a quick reference for users working with command-line automation."
    ```
    
    Alternatively, for a more detailed message, simply run `git commit` without `-m` and your default text editor will open.

By adhering to these guidelines, we ensure a high-quality, readable, and maintainable Git history for this project.
